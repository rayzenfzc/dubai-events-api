    "description": "A trip to Liverpool wouldn’t be complete without a visit to the Beatles Museum. Venture inside to see a collection of all things belonging to or once part of the history of the most famous band in the world. The collection belongs to the son of The Beatles Road Manager, Roag Best. Roag has built up quite a collection over the past 30 years, with many of the items coming directly from his dad, the late Neil Aspinall.   \r\n\r\nIn their pomp, The Beatles were surrounded by many people, but Neil was their friend and confidante. He later became the head of Apple Corps spearheading such Beatle ventures as Beatles No 1, Let It Be Naked, The Anthology and Love (Cirque du Soleil). The Beatles counted Neil as their friend, and he was trusted by them implicitly. Neil was constantly surrounded by The Beatles and the items that he collected can now be viewed by you at the Liverpool Beatles Museum.\r\n\r\nRoag comes from a very famous family. His brother, Pete Best, was The Beatles first drummer and a key part of their rise to fame. Pete’s insights into the early years are without doubt of crucial significance to the making of what The Beatles became.\r\n\r\nHis mother, Mona Best, was founder of the Casbah Coffee Club, the first rock and roll club in Liverpool. She provided The Beatles with a venue to practice and perform in, which Sir Paul McCartney affectionately refers to as “our club”. She managed many of their early business affairs and amongst many other things championed their return to Hamburg after their deportation.\r\n\r\nExplore authentic items including guitars and drums from the Hamburg days, interviews with the band, John Lennon’s itinerary from their first American tour, the mysterious cello from “Magical Mystery Tour”, medals from the pop art masterpiece “Sgt Pepper”, the earliest ever footage of the Beatles playing live, genuine gold and platinum discs, personal letters and belongings, studio monitors from the iconic Abbey Road Studios and so much more.\r\n\r\nA visit to the Liverpool Beatles museum will put you shoulder to shoulder with The Beatles and their journey from 1959 to 1970.

Enjoy the sights from a different perspective as a friendly and knowledgeable team guides you leisurely up and downstream.\t<strong>Tour Highlights</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /> Boats depart from both the King&rsquo;s Staith landing and the Lendal Bridge landing. Admire the scenery from the comfort of the enclosed saloon or the upper deck and treat yourself to a refreshing drink from the bar. &nbsp; <br /><br />The duration of the cruise is either 45 minutes or 1 hour and is determined by the weather on the day and by demand. Your ticket will be valid for whatever duration is offered on the day of your visit. &nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Typically the 1-hour cruise follows a route that heads upstream to Clifton Bridge on the northern outskirts of York city and then downstream as far as the Millennium Bridge on the city&rsquo;s southern outskirts, before returning back upstream to the original landing stage. The 45-minute cruise operates in the same area without going quite as far in either direction, passing through the center of the walled city. &nbsp; <br /><br />During the cruise, the captain will keep you entertained with live commentary about the sites you pass. Learn about York&rsquo;s history of flooding and its prosperity as an inland port, as you sail along the river that brought the Romans and the Vikings to this site. &nbsp; <br /><br />You&rsquo;ll sail on a vessel that features an enclosed and heated saloon, rest rooms and a fully stocked bar serving beers, wines, spirits, soft drinks, hot drinks and snacks. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Timings</strong><br /> &nbsp; <strong>Start time:</strong> King's Staith at 10:30am, 12:00pm, 1:30pm, 3:00pm &amp; 4:00pm &nbsp; <br /><br /> <strong>Inclusions</strong><br /><br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>&nbsp;River cruise</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp;Live commentary</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp;Access to on-board facilities (enclosed and heated saloon,rest rooms and a fully stocked bar serving beers, wines, spirits, soft drinks, hot drinks and snacks.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br /><br /><strong>Exclusions</strong> <br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Gratuities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp; <strong>Important Note</strong><br /><br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Additional sailings can operate every 30 minutes between these times, you will be advised of this whilst waiting.</li>\r\n<li>The usual route turns at Clifton Bridge and Millennium Bridge, but can vary.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br /><strong>Where We Meet:</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />King's Staith landing, King's Staith, York, YO1 9SN\tExperience the beauty and history of York from a unique vantage point with the York City Sightseeing Cruise, an entertaining and informative tour along the picturesque River Ouse. Departing from both the King&rsquo;s Staith landing and the Lendal Bridge landing, this leisurely cruise offers you the chance to admire the city&rsquo;s landmarks from a new perspective. &nbsp; <br /><br />The duration of the York river cruise is either 45 minutes or 1 hour, depending on the weather and demand on the day of your visit. Your ticket will be valid for the duration offered, ensuring a flexible and enjoyable experience. The 1-hour cruise typically travels upstream to Clifton Bridge on York&rsquo;s northern outskirts and downstream to the Millennium Bridge on the southern outskirts, providing a comprehensive tour of the city&rsquo;s scenic riverside. The 45-minute cruise covers a similar route but remains within the city&rsquo;s walled center. &nbsp; <br /><br />Relax in the comfort of the enclosed, heated saloon or enjoy the fresh air on the upper deck. As you sail, the captain&rsquo;s live commentary will enrich your journey with fascinating insights into York&rsquo;s rich history, including its frequent flooding and its significance as an inland port.

Whether you choose a refreshing drink from the bar or simply sit back and enjoy the view, the York Boat Cruise promises a memorable and relaxing experience.

Visitors pose with the paintings and become “part of the art\", creating fun memories and unbeatable Instagram-worthy photos. Explore this colourful interactive gallery and have a blast!\r\n\r\n3D World brings you closer to art through the use of ‘trick-art’ paintings and optical illusions.\r\n\r\nChannel your inner child and let the fun begin at 3D Selfie Museum Dubai!\t3D World is a 23,000 sq. ft where you can indulge your creativity and imagination museum. There's a whole lot of art to indulge in but the process works best if you let your imagination run wild. That's how you achieve some magical photos! If you're really not into imagining stuff, don't worry! Our friendly staff will gladly help you come up with ideas that will create memories for you to take home. The term 'three-dimensional art' refers to a traditional art technique Trompe-l'oeil. Trompe-l'&oelig;il is French for \"deceive the eye\", something that misleads or deceives the senses, creating an illusion. This technique turns two-dimensional paintings into three-dimensional images through the use of optical illusions. Paintings on the walls, ceilings and ground bring you into the setting of the scene and suddenly you become part of the artwork. Illusions are images that are deceptive and misleading. Combining them with art creates an impression of a three-dimensional object on a flat surface. It allows visitors to interact with the art piece and save these memories on camera.

    "description": "Visit the iconic Churchill War Rooms, part of Imperial War Museums, which sheltered Sir Winston Churchill and his wartime government throughout the Second World War. Explore the underground bunker network that protected the staff and secrets at the heart of the British government as Churchill and his inner circle plotted the route to Allied victory.\tThe Cabinet War Rooms Construction on The Cabinet War Rooms, located beneath the Treasury building in the Whitehall area of Westminster, was completed on 27 August 1939, a week before Britain declared war on Germany. Get a glimpse of what life was like for those working in the bunker around the clock during Britain's darkest hour as the German Wehrmacht swept across Europe. In the Cabinet Room, you'll visit the nerve centre of the bunker complex and the place where the War Cabinet met. Those with a keen eye may be able to spot the scratch marks on Churchill's chair at the head of the table; a result of the Prime Minister's nervous clutching at the arms and wear caused by his signet ring. The Map Room Step back in time in the Map Room, which has been left as it was on the day the lights were switched off in 1945: On the walls, you'll notice hundreds of pin holes on the maps used to mark the progress of fleets across the ocean. Visitors will also get to see the top-secret Transatlantic Telephone Room used by Churchill to communicate with the President of the United States The Churchill Museum Discover Sir Winston Churchill's story in this fantastic exhibition dedicated to personal items and artefacts of the time, including his paintings, cigars and the door of No. 10 Downing Street. Learn about the remarkable story of Churchill's life, from his lonely childhood to his military career and two periods as Prime Minister.
